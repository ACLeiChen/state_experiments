Welcome to the companion repository to the Google I/O talk by
@mjohnsullivan and @filiph.

The meat of this repo is in the `shared/` directory. That contains our
shopping app example built in many different architectural patterns.

The two `hello_world*/` directories are the incrementer app before
the live coding session and after it.

This is not an official Google product.
